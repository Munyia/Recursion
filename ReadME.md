# Palindrome Checker

This JavaScript code checks if a given word is a palindrome.

## Functionality

The code defines a function `isPalindrome(word)` that returns `true` if the word is a palindrome and `false` otherwise. A word is considered a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right and from right to left.
